This repository contains the code for my exploration of the "New York Taxi Trip Duration Prediction" dataset from Kaggle.	
New York City Taxi Trip Duration: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/overview
You can also download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data
To make our prediction I will use Ridge and Lasso regressions,cross-validation, OneHotEncorder, GridSearchCV.
